# Healenium-Proxy mode configuration

# When running tests against Healenium-Proxy, instruct the factory to route
# RemoteWebDriver sessions to the proxy instead of the Selenium Grid. The
# proxy URL must be reachable from the test host.
useHealeniumProxy=true

# Address of the Healenium-Proxy server. Adjust host and port as needed.
healenium.proxy.url=http://localhost:8085

# Explicitly disable the library-based healing wrapper. When useHealeniumProxy
# is true, the code will ignore this flag, but it is included here for
# readability.
